This pack made for optimization vanilla and fix bugs. Based on Vanilla Extension, but without decorations and edited some settings for better performance. I want to port this modpack to Quilt, Forge and Neoforge in future too.
If you want more feature and experience that you can install my main project [Vanilla Extension](https://modrinth.com/modpack/vanilla-extension) or my young project [[JWN] Just what is needed](https://modrinth.com/modpack/jwn) for just player who like more vanilla without decorations.)))

 **üìàPerformance**

  **‚öôÔ∏èBugofix**

Somitimes bugs can be features, but in most cases, they only bothered, so I added mods to the modpack that fix most of them.

</details>

I won't support 1.20.2 and 1.20.4. Because they have some problems with Quilt, Forge and NeoForge and devs less update mods for them. Please, use 1.20.1 or 1.20.6+. It's hard for me to update so many versions (understand me).
